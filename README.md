# [Bitfocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion)

CompanionPi is a prebuilt image for the Raspberry Pi 4B, setup to run [Bitfocus Companion](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion)

This repository houses the tooling for building the images, only issues relating to the image building/updating should be reported here.

This also works on other headless Debian or Ubuntu machines.

## Companion Pi

Prebiult images can be found on the [Bitfocus website](https://bitfocus.io/companion)

Note: This has been written for arm64 images, and is not tested or supported on anything below a 4B. We do not recommend running it on anything lower, but you can follow the [manual install instuctions](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion/wiki/Installation) if you are sure you want to.

## Other Debian/Ubuntu

No images are provided for this, but the process has been written to be a single script.

As root, run the following:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitfocus/companion-pi/main/install.sh | bash
```

After this, you can use `sudo companion-update` to change the version it has installed.

Note: This script will create a new user called `companion`, which Companion will be run as and will own the configuration.

### v2.4.2

It used to be possible to install v2.4.2, but this now has issues which cause the build to fail. This is not trivial to resolve, and is not something we support doing

If you want to install v2.4.2, the script from above can be used with a couple of extra steps

- `sudo git clone https://github.com/bitfocus/companion.git -b stable-2.4 stable-2.4 /usr/local/src/companion`
- `sudo companion-update`

Be aware that the update command will take many minutes to run

### Development

Warning: This has only been tested on linux, but it should work wherever packer is supported.

This repository utilises [packer](https://www.packer.io/) to build images, using an [arm-image plugin](https://github.com/solo-io/packer-plugin-arm-image) to add to an official raspberry-pi-lite image.

After installing packer, set it up for this project: `packer init companionpi.pkr.hcl`.

You can then perform the build with `packer build --var pibranch=main companionpi.pkr.hcl`. Be aware that this can be very slow, due to the cpu architecture emulation.

Once complete, the file `output-companionpi/image` can be written to an sd card and launched on a pi
